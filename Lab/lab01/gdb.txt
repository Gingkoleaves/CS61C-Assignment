1.While you’re in a gdb session, how do you set the arguments that will be passed to the program when it’s run?
before run the program, input "set args arg1 arg2 ..."

2.How do you create a breakpoint?
break [funName/line_number]

3.How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
next

4.If the next line of code is a function call, you’ll execute the whole function 
call at once if you use your answer to # (If not, consider a different command for #3!) 
How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function 
(i.e. step into the function) instead? (If you changed your answer to #3, 
then that answer is most likely now applicable here.)
step

5.How do you continue the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
continue/next

6.How can you print the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
display 会在每次step显示变量，而print只是打印一次

7.How do you configure gdb so it displays the value of a variable after every step?
display

8.How do you show a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
info locals

9.How do you quit out of gdb?
q
